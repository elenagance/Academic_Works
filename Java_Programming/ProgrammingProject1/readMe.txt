//Programming Exercise 4.2

First thing I did was write down the exercise as it was written in algorithm form, as comments inside the java file.

In order to get a year from the user as the program prompted, I utilized the examples we did in class to model the start of the program. Namely, I incorporated the scanner to obtain the (y=year) value from the user. 

I then went ahead and followed the algorithm. Using the % function in Java to obtain remainder, something we had learned in class as well as from the text book, to get the remainder and the ‘/‘ to get the quotient when prompted by the algorithm. 

When initially writing this program, I had a problem with c, as java stated the variable was not initialized, I realized then that I was dividing by c while defining c instead of diving by 100. 

After the program compiled successfully, and I ran it, I did not obtain the proper Easter date for 2001 that was in our textbook, so I had to go back into the code to check my algorithm. 

I printed a statement to compare all of the alphabetical values to those provided in the book and noticed a discrepancy with the p value. I went back into the code and saw that I had utilized the wrong formula in the algorithm and in the code, in correcting it, after testing the code again after another compile, the program produced the correct result

//Programming Exercise 4.8 

First thing I did was write out the exercise in the terminal. I then looked to Example2 from class. Because the program warns about working with pennies, I wanted to see if I could manipulate the input from the user into pennies without prompting them to enter that (making my program seem more like an actual cash register program). In using the cast method that we learned from class on 2-4-16, I multiplied the given double of the user by 100 to get the int penny amount. To test this I compiled the program and printed the result before continuing. It worked. The program multiplied the decimal amount by 100, changing it essentially into a penny amount. 

I did the same with the amount received before continuing. 

I followed the same concept from Example2 in obtaining amounts and remainders to calculate the change.

After testing the program, and cleaning the print line methods to look more aesthetically proper, 
I erased the testers I had implemented in the beginning to see if my cast method was working correctly.

Testing it again, I realized I left out the dimes in the print out, went into pico to fix it again. After that, I tested several more times with various amounts to reassure myself that there were no more bugs.
